## 💭 Why I Built This

This portfolio represents not just my technical skills, but my journey as a developer. Having recently relocated to the U.S. with a strong CS foundation, I wanted to create something that showcases both my coding abilities and my design sensibilities. Each project featured here reflects a different aspect of my growth and interests in the development world — and I'm excited to bring that same energy into a professional team setting.
