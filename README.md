# 🧑‍💻 Eli Harel – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

This project showcases who I am, what I've built, and where I'm heading as a frontend developer.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Eli Harel, a frontend-focused developer with a strong foundation in computer science. I hold a Magna Cum Laude CS degree from Israel and recently relocated to the U.S. I've spent the past few years sharpening my skills in **React**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **C#**, and now I'm actively looking for my first professional developer role.

While I don't yet have formal industry experience, I've built several personal projects, and I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code with a strong user focus.
